## Tools
 * SoX (Sound Exchange)
   - The Swiss Army knife of sound processing programs.SoX is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS X, etc.) command line utility that can convert various formats
     of computer audio files in to other formats. It can also apply various effects to these sound files, and, as an added bonus, SoX can play and record audio 
     files on most platforms.
  * [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)   
     - A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.
 * Pylab 
   - An open source graph generation library
 * Librosa
   - [Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) is a python package for music and audio analysis. It provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems
 * [python_speech_features](https://python-speech-features.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   - This library provides common speech features for ASR including MFCCs and filterbank energies.
 * [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/index.html)
   - Open-source library and tools for audio and music analysis, description and synthesis
